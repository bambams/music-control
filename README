This is just a simple project with wrapper scripts around my music player
of choice so I can [more] easily control it from the command-line. Since
cmus already has cmus-remote for that this might seem redundant, but these
wrappers just provider much shorter commands to control it so that I don't
have to type 15+ characters for every operation.

The lib directory contains semantically named scripts. The Makefile
installs symlinks with more symbolic names into PREFIX/bin. The default
install destination is $HOME.

>    Play.
=    Pause.
[]   Stop.
->   Next song.
<-   Previous song.
+    Increase volume.
-    Decrease volume.

Keep in mind that some of these characters are special to some shells so
you will need to escape or quote them. E.g., in most UNIX shells you would
type \> for play.
